# Shelter_Dog_Recommendation_System
Program designed to recommend one of the top five most common shelter dog breeds using machine learning for a WGU Capstone project

I created this project for my WGU capstone. I decided on the subject in order to promote one of my passions, reducing the stereotypes around some of the most common 
shelter dog breeds. I provided my pdf write up of the project including how to use the program and updates I would like to make to the program in the future. As of now, 
the program is designed to run within Jupyter notebooks, but the hope is to create a better GUI interface to make the presentation of the data cleaner and more
user friendly.
